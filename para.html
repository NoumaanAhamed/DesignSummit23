    <p>Open-Source Contribution involves contributing to the development or improvement of open-source software.
        It refers to the practice of sharing the source code of software and other projects with the public.
         It allows anyone to view, use, modify, and distribute the code, fostering collaboration and innovation within a community of developers and users.
          Open source software is typically free to use and is often developed by a global community of volunteers who work together to improve and maintain the project. 
          This open and collaborative approach has led to the creation of many popular and valuable software tools and projects.
